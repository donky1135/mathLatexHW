	\textit{Recall that for a three-dimensional box, with side length $a,b$ and $c$, the volume is $abc$, the
surface area is $2(ab + bc + ac)$ and the total length of all edges) is $4(a + b + c)$. (If you don't
remember this, draw yourself a picture and check it.) Provide an example of two boxes, Box
1 and Box 2, where Box 1 has larger volume than Box 2, Box 1 has larger total edge length
than Box 2, but Box 1 has smaller surface area than Box 2.}

Let $Box1 = (10,10,1),$ and $Box2 = (1.2,7,13).$  I'm going to be honest I tried working through the inequalities but without much luck in the end.  I thought by dissecting a cube and recombining it I could optimize for surface area, that works but the additional constraint of edge width left me scratching my head.  Ultimately desmos came to save the day, and I just found a pizza box shaped object in the form of Box1 and then played around until I found the dimensions for Box2 which fit the constraints that I put in \href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gdptj8hhbh}{here}.
