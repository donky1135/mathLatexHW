	\item Let $(W,\leq)$ be a linearly order set.  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  $\Rightarrow$ Suppose $W$ is well ordered.  We want to show that there does not 
		exists a descending chain.  Suppose for contradiction that there is a sequence $(w_n)_{n \in \N}$ where $w_n > w_{n+1}$.  Since $W$ is well order than 
		$\min (w_n)$ exists.  Since $(w_n)$ has a minimum then there exists 
		$n' \in \N$ such that for all $n \in \N, w_{n'} \leq w_n$.  Note that 
		$w_{n'+1} < w_{n'}$ by the definition of $(w_n)$.  Therefore $w_{n'+1} < w_{n'}$ and $w_{n'+1} \geq w_{n'}$.  This is a contradiction.  Therefore a descending chain does not exists.  
		\item $\Leftarrow$ Suppose $W$ is not well ordered.  We want to show that there exists 
		a descending chain.  Since $W$ is not well ordered then there exists a set
		$S$ where $S \neq \emptyset, S \subseteq W$ where $\min S$ does not exists.  Since $S$ is nonempty then there exists $x_1 \in S$.  Note that $\min \{x_1\}$ exists, therefore there exists $x_2 \in S$ such that $x_2 < x_1$.  Therefore by induction $\{x_1,\cdots,x_n\} \subset S$, since $\min \{x_1,\cdots,x_n\}$ exists.  Therefore there exists $x_{n+1} \in S$ such that $x_{n+1} < x_n$.  Therefore by induction we have constructed a descending chain.

		\item We will show that $\Phi: \Po(\N) \to \R$ given by $\Phi(A) = \sum_{n \in A} \frac{2}{3^n}$ is an injection.
		Suppose $A,B \in \Po(\N), A\neq B$.  Since $A \neq B$ then the symmetric difference $A \Delta B$ is nonempty.  
		Since $A \Delta B \subseteq \N$, then $A \Delta B$ has a minimal element.  Let this element be denoted $m$, and 
		WLOG assume $m \in A$.  If we consider $\Phi(A) - \Phi(B) = \sum_{n \in A} \frac{2}{3^n}-\sum_{n \in B} \frac{2}{3^n} = \sum_{n \in A\backslash [m-1]} \frac{2}{3^n} - \sum_{n \in B\backslash [m-1]} \frac{2}{3^n}$ since $A$ and $B$
		must share every element less than $m$, otherwise contradicting $m$ is the smallest element in $A \Delta B$.
		Note that we can bound the difference below by considering $\sum_{n \in A \backslash [m-1]} \frac{2}{3^n} \geq \frac{2}{3^m}, -\sum_{n \in B \backslash [m-1]}\frac{2}{3^n}\geq -\sum_{n \in \N \backslash [m-1]}\frac{2}{3^n}$

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We claim that $card((\{0,1\}^\N)^\N) = card(\{0,1\}^{\N\times \N})$.
		Note that $(\{0,1\}^\N)^\N$ is the set of of sequences of infinite binary sequences.  Therefore for a given $f \in (\{0,1\}^\N)^\N$ we have that $f(n) = (b_{nk})_{ k\in \N}$ for all $n \in \N$.  If we define $g:(\{0,1\}^\N)^\N) \to \{0,1\}^{\N\times \N}$ by $g(f) = (b_{nk})_{(n,k) \in \N^2}$, then this is clearly a bijection.  Thus $card((\{0,1\}^\N)^\N) = card(\{0,1\}^{\N\times \N})$.
		Therefore: $$card(\R^\N) = card((\{0,1\}^\N)^\N) = card(\{0,1\}^{\N\times \N}) = card(\{0,1\}^{\N}) = card(\R)$$.    
		\item Let $S$ be some countable set, and let $X = \{S^n : n \in \N\}$.  We want to show that $X$ is countable.  
		Note that $S$ is countable, and therefore $S^n$ is countable by slide 22 of lecture 14.  Since $S^n$ and $\N$ is countable, then $\bigcup_{n \in \N}^\infty S^n$ is countable.  Since $\bigcup_{n=1}^\infty S^n = X$, then we're done.  
		\item Note that a polynomial is uniquely determined by it's coefficients.
		Therefore the set of polynomials over $\Z$ has the same cardinality as all of the finite integer sequences  Thus $card(\Z[x]) = card(\{\Z^n: n \in \N\}).$  
		Since $\{\Z^n: n \in \N\}$ is countable then $\Z[x]$ is countable
		\item Note that since $\Z[x]$ is countable and for $p \in \Z[x]$ the set
		$r(p) = \{p(x) = 0 : x \in \R \}$ is finite, then $\bigcup_{p \in \Z[x]} r(p)$ is countable.  Note that this is exactly the set of algebraic numbers.  Additionally, since we've found a countable subset of the real numbers, then 
		there are an uncountable number of numbers not in our set.  Thus real algebraic numbers exists \\ 
		\item Suppose for contradiction that there is a finite number of prime numbers.  Let the set of primes be denoted
		$\{p_1,\cdots,p_n\}$.  Consider the number $l = 1 + \prod_{i=1}^n p^i$.  Note that for each prime $p_i, l \equiv 1 \mod{p_i}$.  Thus $l$ is divisible by none of the prime numbers.  Since $l$ can't be divide by primes, it can't be divide by the product of any of the primes.  Thus $l$ is only divisible by 1 and itself.  Thus $l$ is prime.  This contradicts the fact that  $\{p_1,\cdots,p_n\}$ is the set of all primes.  Thus there is an infinite number of primes.
